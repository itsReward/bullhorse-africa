# Bullhorse Africa

A vanilla JavaScript website using a JSON file as a database.

## How to Run

Because this project uses ES6 Modules (import/export), **you cannot simply open index.html in a browser** directly from the file system due to CORS security policies.

You must serve it via a local server.

### Option 1: Python (Pre-installed on Mac/Linux)
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Then open http://localhost:8000

### Option 2: VS Code Live Server
If you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live".
